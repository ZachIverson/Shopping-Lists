# Shopping-Lists
FP1-F02 Shopping List
In CS20, you may have made a shopping list program using our list arrays. For this program, you are going to create a program that uses a dictionary to create a shopping list with key:value items that are the items to buy and the cost. Your program should start out with a blank dictionary, and allow a user to enter any number of items they wish and their costs, print out their lists of items, delete or modify their items, and calculate a total cost at the end.
